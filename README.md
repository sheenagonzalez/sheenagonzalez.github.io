This website is my online portfolio displaying a gallery of my past works, my development process, and who I am as a UX Designer/Developer.

This is a solo project written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No API frameworks were used because I was trying to learn coding in raw format to get a better understanding of fundamental front-end engineering. For the illustrations, I used Adobe Illustrator. For the prototype, I used Figma, Sketch and InVision. This was an initial passion project for a Web Design/Development course in 2017, that I reworked this past August 2020 to revamp the whole design aesthetics, self-branding, and usability.
